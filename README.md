# AI-and-Biotechnology-Bioinformatics-Internship-2025

Research Internship Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the work completed during my 4-week research internship on Omics Data Analysis using Machine Learning. This experience provided me with the opportunity to apply computational tools and statistical models to explore real-world biological datasets, with a focus on integrating bioinformatics and machine learning approaches. This repository is a personal record of everything I’ve been learning and creating at the intersection of computational biology, molecular genetics, and data science.

Throughout this internship, I've been working on developing core programming skills in R, exploring how machine learning can be applied to omics datasets, and finding ways to connect my background in wet-lab biology with the world of computational analysis.

This space captures my growth, from the basics to more applied projects—always with the aim of understanding biological systems better and contributing to research that matters.

# Overview
This repository documents my learning journey and outputs developed during the internship, where I focused on:

- Omics Data Preprocessing and Analysis
- Application of R Programming in Bioinformatics
- Machine Learning Models for biological pattern recognition and prediction
- Scientific Report Writing and research communication
- Critical Thinking under guided mentorship

# Contact

If you're working in computational biology, genomics, or anything related to AI in life sciences, I’d love to connect and learn from others in the field.
